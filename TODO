# Major

- Add double buffer rendering to allow for constructive shaders
- Add a webcam/video/image texture support
- Add Non realime rendering to generate HD videos for the inernet
- Clean shaders utils to have coherent and understandable tools
- Handle the usual problem with the RPIs networks in the wild; either through a dedicated router, or through a peer2peer network

# Minor

- Add support for kinect
- Add support for text
- Handle support of glsl with higher versions than 100. RPI4 should support it.
